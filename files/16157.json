street  7th floor  bugis junction office tower  singapore 188024 \r\ndear mr .  khaw  \r\napplication for the position of senior officer  int\u2019l operations  \r\ni would like to express my special thanks for your career information in nus campus talk on 8 march 2006 .  with regards to the talk  i am writing to seek the opportunity in your company .  with active participation in faculty activities  and strong background knowledge of finance and marketing coupled with research and consultancy skills  i am confident of my ability to be the suitable candidate you are looking for or to contribute to ie singapore in any areas of my studies    finance and marketing and technopreneurship .  \r\nthere are at least three reasons that prompt me to opt for this position at ie singapore .  first of all  i would very much like to be exposed to a challenging working environment that offers global perspective .  through the website www.iesingapore.com and other resources  i am convinced that ie singapore  with her relentless efforts to create exceptional values through problem solving and value added services for the clients  is a very good hub to help nurture and develop talents  expertise  integrity and leadership skills .  secondly  i highly appreciate the cultural values at ie singapore where work life balance is accentuated and taken care of .  last but not least  it is my analytical and enthusiastic nature coupled with a selfmotivated desire to excel and take up challenges that convince me i am well cut out for the position at ie singapore .  \r\nmuch far as my academic background is concerned  i have just graduated from national university of singapore with a merit bachelor degree in december 2005 .  as a fresh graduate  i have not accumulated much working experience .  nevertheless  my key assets lie in a solid analytical mindset of corporate finance and marketing doctrines and the keenness to autonomously learn new things .  \r\nbesides my studies  most of my time was spent on school activities and singapore social projects as addressed in my attached detailed r\u00e9sum\u00e9 .  and in addition to all the foregoing  i have also worked as a research assistant in nus consulting  nco  .  i have garnered invaluable experience from some projects done for nco  namely the maritime manpower study for singapore maritime and port authority  bt gbi business climate survey which is conducted quarterly and jointly by the business times and global business insights of ie singapore to track changes in the business climate in singapore and overseas .  ms .  chow kit boey  my economics professor as well as the ex director of nco  is the one who nurtures my development and most of my research skills are now the inherits from her experience during my memorable time in nus .  \r\nwith these qualifications and working experience  i think my professional skills and knowledge help me to seek an opportunity to be part of ie singapore .  i am also eligible to apply for permanent residence invited by singapore immigration &amp  checkpoints authority upon securing a job offer .  i understand that as an aftermath of globalization  ie singapore is planning to expand the operations to other countries  one of which is my nation  vietnam .  therefore i hope i can be together with you building up a strong expansion scheme .  i would very much welcome the opportunity to be able to attend the interview .  i really look forward to further discussing with you as regards my commitment to ie ingapore .  \r\nyours faithfully  \r\ntran nguyen hoang son\r\n\r\nbtc\r\n"}
